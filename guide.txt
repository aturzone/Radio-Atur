# Cozy Audio Café - Developer Guide

This document provides guidance for developers working on the Cozy Audio Café project.

## Code Organization

- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Place reusable UI components in `src/components/ui/`
- Place player-specific components in `src/components/player/`
- Store contexts in `src/contexts/`
- Store pages in `src/pages/`
- Keep utility functions in `src/utils/`

## Style Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow the existing color scheme (coffee theme with light/dark variants)
- Use the shadcn/ui component library for consistent UI elements
- Ensure all UI is responsive and works on mobile devices

## Adding Features

When adding new features:

1. Consider where the feature belongs in the existing architecture
2. Create new components for complex UI elements
3. Update relevant contexts if the feature requires state management
4. Add the feature to the appropriate page
5. Update any relevant documentation

## Google Drive Integration

The Google Drive integration uses:

- `googleIntegration.ts` - Core API functions
- `GoogleIntegrationContext.tsx` - React context for state management
- `GoogleDriveConnect.tsx` - UI component for connecting to Google Drive

To modify the Google Drive integration, update these files as needed.

## Best Practices

- Use TypeScript types for all props and state
- Add appropriate error handling
- Ensure accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- Test on multiple browsers and devices
- Keep bundle size small by avoiding unnecessary dependencies
